# CellMorphology
**Under development**

Python code to binarize noisy input images of microscopic images for further cell morphology analysis.

Attempted localized edge detection, noise elimination, and edge propagation. 
Clustering functional
segmentation needs touch-ups, constrictions identified OK, bends pending
Stack image collation needs review
